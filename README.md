# Puzzle Collection
The goal of this project is to create a collection of number puzzles that the user can play. I am using the code I made for my Game Architecture class at Champlain College as a basis and Allegro to help with graphics, input systems, font, and sound in the future. 

# Current State
Currently, this program works with a simple sudoku puzzle. The user can play either a 9x9 or 6x6 game of sudoku with an easy, medium, or hard difficulty. The user can use the note system to plan out the solution and the number inputted will display whether the user was right or wrong. There is a score system in play that adds up the correct inputs with additional score added for each row, column, and box completed. The win state is achieved once the entire board is filled out and correct. You can leave the game and load it back in through the load option, but as of the current state there are no save options, so the game must be kept running.

# Future Plans
I would like to include different puzzles in the future. Here is a basic list:
* Killer Sudoku
* Futoshiki
* Kakuro
* Cross Sum

Puzzles may be added or deleted as I continue to work on this project.

Additionally, there are other features that I hope to add, including:
* Save puzzle states
* Music and sound effects
* Animations

# About Me
My name is Hannah Fasco, I am currently a 4th year at Champlain College, and I made this project as something to work on for fun in my free time. I very much enjoy number puzzles like sudoku and futoshiki so I thought it would be enjoyable to program. While I plan to continue to work on this, updates will be sporatic as will be busy will classwork.

I hope you enjoy playing this small game!

# DISCLAIMER
All code from DeanLib is from my Game Architecture professor: Dean Lawson, Champlain College. I did not edit or contribute to this code in any way.

The rest of the code was mostly taken from my midterm, with some taken from my final that I worked on with my partner Nate Spielman. All code he contributed in should be noted in the header files of each class.
