# Puzzle Collection
The goal of this project is to create a collection of number puzzles that the user can play. I am using the code I made for my Game Architecture class at Champlain College as a basis and Allegro to help with graphics, input systems, font, and sound in the future.

This is a passion project of mine, as I love all kinds of puzzles and have been playing sudoku since I was a small child. I am still currently in school, so while there are planned updates to this project, they will be sporatic as I finish my degree.

I hope you enjoy playing this small game!

## Disclaimer
All code from DeanLib is from my Game Architecture professor: Dean Lawson, Champlain College. I did not edit or contribute to this code in any way.

The rest of the code was mostly taken from my Game Architecture midterm, with some taken from my final that I worked on with my partner Nate Spielman. All code he contributed in should be noted in the header files of each class.
